# Journey
 Pros:
 - learning new knowledges, like interactive charts, finance, basic statistics...
 - Understand clearly how strong pandas is,...
 - The way to convert jupyter notebook to pdf, which characteristics to analyze, clean and preprocess data, read docs,...
 - How to write `*.md` and git command.
 - Many things I faced to, but forgetting...
 - I found some other fields I'm interested in; exploring myself, not only dataset.
 
 Cons:
 - The file size of `*.ipynb` is too large (~7MB) and I don't know the issues, how to optimize its capacity.
 - The knowledge is limitless, I need to learn more and more.
 - Many questions about crypto market, but I can't answer with these datasets: Distribution holders all over the world by each coin?, which coins have trust?...
